                    </h3>
                    <p>Neutron stars are one of the possible evolutionary end-points of high mass stars. They're born in a core-collapse supernova star explosion and subsequently rotate extremely rapidly as a consequence of their physics. Neutron stars can
                        rotate up to 60 times per second after born. </p>

                    <p>Sound waves need a medium to travel through. Since there is no atmosphere in the vacuum of space, the realm between stars will always be eerily silent. That said, worlds with atmospheres and air pressure do allow sound to travel, hence
                        why there's plenty of noise on Earth and likely other planets as well.

                        in the universe.

                    <p>Our star, the sun, is so dense that it accounts for a whopping 99 percent of the mass of our entire solar system. That's what allows it to dominate all of the planets gravitationally.

                        area is approximately equal to the land area of India or Argentina.

                    <p>Navigation will be weird when Polaris stops being the North Star in about 13,000 years. In case you didn't know, Earth's axis goes through a motion called "precession" which means that the planet's axis will change, and trace out the
                        shape of a cone--even if it's slightly. When this occurs, it takes around 26,000 years for the axis to trace out a complete cone shape. To add to this, Polaris, the Earth's current "North Star" will eventually begin to shift positions
                        as the Earth undergoes precession.

                        to merge, probably having a triple nucleus for a while, while the stars we are familiar with will also form new constellations, but eventually the galactic collision will settle down resulting in a brand new massive elliptical
                        galaxy. </p>
